# Overview

In these folders You will find project templates/code snippets, guidelines, reference implementations and resources for storing secrets in git repositories -  in a (kind of) secure manner.

The examples cover cloud-native and on-premise scenarios in various languages and frameworks. For each secret management solution there is a folder (or two, for cloud-native+on-premise), in each of these folders there is a `common` directory containing guides on how to initially set them up. The other folders are language specific use cases for the most basic read operations.

# How to contribute
Feel free to request guides for other SMSs or other languages via Issues - although no guarantees to implement them.
Pull requests are also welcome. Please try to follow the used structure, if You decide to contribute!
